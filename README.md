[I had a problem with the Github pages so I decided to publish the task on a different server.
I have implemented SSL so there is nothing to worry about.]

## Informations ‚ÑπÔ∏è

The task was carried out according to the design in Figma.

I decided to make a responsive layout.

Besides React, I used TypeScript. I believe that TS is becoming the standard for working with JavaScript these days.

I didn't use any component library (Material UI or Bootstrap). I tried to implement everything myself using React and css styles.

I added some animations, hovers etc as mentioned in the email.

## Summary:

Thank you for the opportunity to complete the task for CodiLime. Each task is a new challenge and a fun adventure for me. Hope the code meets the requirements. I count on honest feedback.

Best regards,
Patrycja I≈Ñska
